Animation program used in personal game, Strategy Game.

## Smoke Animation
There are two type of smoke animation
- Realistic
- Animated
Realistic uses radial gradation to have smoky dispersion look. However this color gradation effect was very slow.
So, I introduced animated smoke, which is just smoke without color gradation.

Realistic uses radial gradation to have smoky dispersion look. However this color gradation effect was very slow.
So, I introduced animated smoke, which is just smoke without color gradation.


## Explosion
Simple explosion effect with Java Swing. Bit of spark animation is added too to simulate fragments

## Spark Emitter
Fire particle is emitted from a point in a random direction. Small version of this is used in explosion.
